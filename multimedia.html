      <footer class="site-footer">
        
        <p>From this exercise you should have learnt: Use accusative if there is a significant change of location/position. In other words, if the action has moved from one place to a different place, or a specific "border" has been crossed.

You should use dative if the former does not occur, i.e. if the action is occurring in a confined, defined space.
